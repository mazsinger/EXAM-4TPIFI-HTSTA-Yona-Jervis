<h1>Exercise 3</h1>
<h1>a)</h1>
    <p> the following chemical reaction is an acid-base reaction (also known as a neutralization reaction).
    In this particular case, a strong acid, sulphuric acid, reacts with a strong base, sodim hydroxide (aka caustic soda or lye), 
    to produce salt and water:</p>
<!-- Apply subscript to the number to show the chemical equation below in the proper format.-->
    <h1>NaOH + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 + H2O</h1>
